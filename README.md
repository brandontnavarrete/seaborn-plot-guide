# What I am I trying to include on here
-----------------------
* I want to give a short introduction to seaborn.
* I want people to understand different methods of installing seaborn.
* I want to show basic plot types
* I want people to see that there are different way to make their chart unique and visually pleasing.

# Summary
-----------------------
I do see that other guides exist (on github and seaborn's website) but on a local level, to my current classmates and I, I would like to have quick reference sheet. This is not a finished repo. I would like to include more in depth notebooks that can tackles specific or complicated questions.
